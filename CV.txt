In my comprehensive dissertation project, I architectured a three-part framework to tackle malware detection employing real-time system monitoring, machine learning algorithms, and a proof-of-concept ransomware for validation. I engineered a System Monitoring Tool in C# that meticulously logs crucial system and network metrics of running processes. The data harvested is then fed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model which I trained, tested, and optimized to discern malicious processes. To validate the effectiveness of the framework, I crafted a proof-of-concept ransomware, simulating real-world malware. The project culminated in a robust C# .NET application which orchestrates the SVM model across training, testing, and prediction phases providing a user-friendly interface. The dissertation is meticulously documented and includes a comprehensive analysis and discussion on the methodologies employed, the results obtained, and insights for future work. The repository is structured and well-documented, ensuring ease of navigation and understanding for any interested party.
