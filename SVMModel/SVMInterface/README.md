## C# .NET Application

The user interface for this SVM Model Training and Testing system is engineered for simplicity and functionality, encapsulated within a C# .NET application. The primary interface features four distinct buttons labeled "Training", "Testing", "Predict", and "Data Visualisation". Each button, when selected, initiates the corresponding operation, displaying relevant information and results on the right side of the interface. This design promotes a streamlined user experience while offering real-time insights into each step of the machine learning process.

Below is a breakdown of the core functionalities each button triggers:

### Key Features and Operations

1. **Training**:
   - Initiates the `MySvmTrain.exe` executable to train the SVM model on the specified training data set.
   - Displays real-time training progress and results within the interface.

2. **Testing**:
   - Launches the `MySvmTest.exe` executable to test the trained SVM model on a separate testing data set.
   - Showcases the testing results and performance metrics within the interface.

3. **Predict**:
   - Triggers the `MySvmPredict.exe` executable to make predictions on new data using the trained SVM model.
   - Captures and displays the prediction results and evaluation metrics within the interface.

4. **Data Visualisation**:
   - Provides a feature to visualize the data, aiding in better understanding and interpretation of the data being processed.

The C# .NET application serves as an intuitive gateway to interact with the underlying C++ SVM model training, testing, and prediction modules. It amalgamates the complex machine learning processes into a user-friendly interface, making the SVM model operations easily accessible and interpretable to the users.
