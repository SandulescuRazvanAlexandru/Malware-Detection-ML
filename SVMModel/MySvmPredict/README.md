## Background

The code in this repository is part of a larger project that integrates a C# .NET application with a C++ executable for SVM model training. The C++ executable (`mySvmTrain.exe`) is invoked by the C# application to train the SVM model with the help of the modified LIBSVM library. This setup leverages the computational efficiency of C++ for machine learning tasks while utilizing the user-friendly UI of the .NET environment for easy interaction with the program.

## Dependencies

- A modified version of the LIBSVM library.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the C++ executable (`mySvmTrain.exe`) using your preferred C++ compiler.
3. Launch the C# .NET application and follow the instructions to initiate the SVM model training.

The executable accepts input parameters specifying the paths to the dataset and the model file. The following command-line instruction is equivalent to the input provided via the C# application:

```bash
mySvmTrain.exe [options] training_set_file.txt model_file.model
```

## Performance Metrics

Upon executing the training program, a comprehensive output is generated, providing insights into the training process and the SVM model's configuration. Although numerous training options are set to default due to the project's scope, the output elucidates key parameters integral to SVM training, as illustrated in Figure 31 - Output: SVM Training Key Parameters. Here's a synopsis of the essential metrics and information conveyed through the output:

- **Data Reading**: All data points from the input data are read, each line representing an instance to be classified.
- **Solver Iterations**: A series of iterative messages from the "solver", the optimization routine tasked with identifying the SVM model parameters. Each iteration signifies a step towards optimizing the objective function, culminating when the best model parameters are found.
- **Optimization Completion**: Denoted by "optimization finished, #iter = X", indicating the successful completion of the optimization process after X iterations.
- **Nu-SVM Parameter**: In nu-SVM, 'nu' is a pivotal parameter regulating the number of support vectors and training errors, lying within the interval (0,1].
- **Objective Function and Decision Function Parameters**: 'obj' represents the objective function's value at the optimal solution, showcasing how well the SVM fits the training data, while 'rho' is a parameter in the SVM's decision function.
- **Support Vector Metrics**: Details on the number of support vectors ('nSV'), bound support vectors ('nBSV'), and the total number of support vectors used in the SVM model ('Total nSV') are provided.
  
The output further elucidates the SVM model's setup and learned aspects through the `modelFile`:

- **SVM Type and Kernel**: Specifies the SVM type (C-SVC) and kernel (RBF) used, indicating the SVM's suitability for binary classification and its capability to handle non-linearly separable data by mapping it to a higher-dimensional space.
- **Kernel Parameter (gamma)**: Gamma parameter for the RBF kernel, defining the extent of a single training example's influence.
- **Class Handling**: Reveals that the SVM is configured for two-class classification with labels 1 and -1.
- **Support Vector Details**: Contains information on the support vectors, including the total count and distribution among classes, followed by the listing of support vectors with their class values and features.

This detailed output serves as a valuable resource for understanding the SVM model's behavior, diagnosing potential issues, and gaining insight into the training process and the SVM model's learned attributes.
