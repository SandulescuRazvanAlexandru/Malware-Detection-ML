## Prediction Module

The `MySvmPredict.exe` executable, activated by a specific button click in the C# interface, is engineered for deploying the trained SVM model to make predictions on new data sets. The command-line argument structure for this executable is: `MySvmPredict.exe [options] new_data_set_file.txt model_file.model`, though these arguments are managed internally in the code, facilitating a seamless user experience.

This module also utilizes a modified version of the LIBSVM open-source C/C++ library, adjusted to meet the specific needs of this project.

The prediction phase embodies the real-world application of the SVM model, where it's applied to completely new data, unseen during training or testing phases. Here's a breakdown of the key features and output metrics offered by the prediction module:

### Key Features and Performance Metrics

1. **Prediction Execution**:
   - The C# interface enables the execution of the C++ prediction program, capturing and displaying the prediction results within the UI for user convenience.
   - Post-prediction, the output is also recorded in a text file, presenting the SVM model's performance on the new data set.

2. **Prediction Evaluation**:
   - **Accuracy Evaluation**: The program compares the SVM model's predictions with known labels (if available) or our own predictions, marking each instance as "Same" if there's a match, or "Different" if there isn't.
   - **Classification Metrics**: Post prediction, the SVM model computes evaluation metrics like True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), False Negatives (FN), Precision, Recall, etc., providing a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance on new data.

3. **Output Archival**:
   - Similar to the testing phase, the results encompassing the above metrics are not only showcased within the UI but also archived in a text file for further analysis or archival purposes.

This prediction module is vital for examining the SVM model's capability in making accurate predictions on new, unseen data, ensuring its practical applicability and reliability, while also providing a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and result interpretation.
