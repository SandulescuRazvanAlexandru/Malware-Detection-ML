# Malware Detection Using SVM

This repository houses the code and resources for a malware detection system utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM). The system includes a user-friendly C# .NET application, SVMInterface, and C++ executables for SVM model training, testing, and prediction, leveraging a modified version of the LIBSVM open-source C/C++ library.

## Training Module

The Training Module (`MySvmTrain.exe`) facilitates SVM model training with user-defined or default parameters, rendering real-time training progress and metrics.

## Testing Module

The Testing Module (`MySvmTest.exe`) evaluates the trained SVM model's performance on a separate testing dataset, displaying accuracy and other evaluation metrics.

## Prediction Module

The Prediction Module (`MySvmPredict.exe`) enables predictions on new data using the trained SVM model, comparing model predictions with known labels and computing evaluation metrics.

## C# .NET Application (SVMInterface)

SVMInterface provides a streamlined user interface for initiating and observing SVM model training, testing, and prediction operations, enhancing user experience and real-time insight into SVM processes.

### Installation and Usage

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) installed on your machine.
   - Install a C++ compiler, such as [Microsoft Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).

2. **Installation**:
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/SandulescuRazvanAlexandru/Malware-Detection-ML.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the `SVMModel` directory.
   - Build the C++ executables (MySvmTrain.exe, MySvmTest.exe, MySvmPredict.exe) using your C++ compiler.
   - Open `SVMInterface.sln` with Visual Studio and build the solution.

3. **Usage**:
   - Run the `SVMInterface.exe` to launch the application.
   - Use the interface to train, test, and make predictions with the SVM model by selecting the appropriate buttons and following the on-screen instructions.
