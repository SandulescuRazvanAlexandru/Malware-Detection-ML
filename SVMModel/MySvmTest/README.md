## Testing Module

The `MySvmTest.exe` executable, triggered by a specific button click in the C# interface, is a crucial component responsible for evaluating the performance of the pre-trained SVM model using the LIBSVM library. The command-line arguments for this executable are structured as follows: `MySvmTest.exe [options] test_data_set_file.txt model_file.model result_file.txt`, though handled internally in the code for seamless user interaction.

This module uses a modified (by meself) version of the LIBSVM open-source C/C++ library.

The testing module assesses the SVM model on a distinct dataset, unseen during the training phase, to ensure the model's robust generalization capabilities rather than mere memorization of the training data. Here's a breakdown of the key features and output metrics provided by the testing module:

### Key Features and Performance Metrics

1. **Testing Execution**:
   - The C# interface facilitates the execution of the C++ testing program, capturing and presenting the results within the UI for user convenience.
   - Post-testing, the output is also archived in a text file, detailing the SVM model's performance on the testing dataset.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: Denoted as `Accuracy = X%`, this metric outlines the percentage of correct predictions made by the SVM model on the testing dataset.
   - **Instance-wise Evaluation**: Each line in the output, formatted as `Line x is a True Positive/True Negative/False Positive/False Negative`, signifies the correctness of the model's predictions for individual instances.
   - **Classification Counts**: The output enumerates the counts of True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP), and False Negatives (FN), aiding in a more granular understanding of the model's performance.
   - **Extended Performance Metrics**: Besides accuracy, the output elaborates on additional metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1 Score, providing a well-rounded view of the model's performance, particularly beneficial in scenarios with class imbalances.

3. **Output Archival**:
   - The results, encapsulating the above metrics, are not only displayed within the UI but also recorded in a text file (`result_file.txt`) for further analysis or archival purposes.

The testing module is instrumental in evaluating the SVM model's efficacy, ensuring its reliability, and readiness for deployment in practical scenarios, while also offering a user-friendly interface for effortless interaction and result interpretation.
