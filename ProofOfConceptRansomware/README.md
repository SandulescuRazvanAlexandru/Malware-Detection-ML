# Proof of Concept Ransomware

This repository contains a simple proof of concept (PoC) ransomware implemented in C#. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the basic workings of ransomware for educational and research purposes only. It is not intended for malicious use.

## Features

- AES Encryption and Decryption
- Basic Networking (HTTP and TCP)
- Error Logging

## How It Works

### Encryption

1. Upon clicking the "Encrypt" button, a random password is generated using the `PasswordGenerator` method.
2. The program attempts to connect to a Command & Control server via TCP and sends a greeting message.
3. The generated password is sent to a specified server via HTTP POST.
4. The AES encryption algorithm is utilized to encrypt files in a specified directory (`D:\\Aplicatie_Disertatie\\MyRansomware\\ToBeRansomwared`). The encryption process is carried out by the `EncryptFilesInDirectory` method, which operates recursively to ensure subdirectories are also processed.

### Decryption

1. Upon clicking the "Decrypt" button, the program initiates the decryption process using the password provided in the text box.
2. The AES decryption algorithm is utilized to decrypt the encrypted files in the specified directory.

### Networking

- Networking operations are facilitated using the `HttpClient` and `TcpClient` classes for HTTP and TCP protocols respectively.

### Error Handling

- Basic error handling is performed with try-catch blocks, logging exceptions to files (`error_connection_log.txt` and `error_connection2_log.txt`).

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.
4. Use the GUI to interact with the program, specifying a directory for encryption/decryption, and providing a password for decryption.
