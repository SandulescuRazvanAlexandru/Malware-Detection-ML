# Malware Detection Framework Dissertation

This repository encompasses the complete framework developed for my dissertation project on constructing a prototype malware detection framework. The objective is to analyze running processes on a local machine, extract critical features, and employ Machine Learning Algorithms - specifically, Support Vector Machines (SVM), to ascertain whether a process is malware. The proof of concept is validated through a ransomware developed specifically for this project.

## Structure

### System Monitoring Tool
- A C# application designed to monitor, log, and aggregate system and network metrics associated with running processes in real-time.
- Features include CPU, RAM, Disk Usage, Network Connection Data Aggregation, and Data Logging.
- [More details here](./SystemMonitoringTool/README.md)

### Proof of Concept Ransomware
- A simple proof of concept ransomware implemented in C# to demonstrate the basic workings of ransomware for educational and research purposes.
- Features include AES Encryption and Decryption, Basic Networking, and Error Logging.
- [More details here](./AESRansomwarePoC/README.md)

### Dataset and Features
- Describes the dataset format (LIBSVM), the features extracted from the system monitoring tool, and how they're utilized in SVM model.
- [More details here](./DatasetAndFeatures/README.md)

### SVM Model
- Contains the SVM model's training, testing, and prediction modules, along with the SVM Interface application for seamless user interaction.
- [More details here](./SVMModel/README.md)

### Dissertation Documentation
- Contains the comprehensive documentation of the project including the thesis pdf and presentation ppt.
- [More details here](./Documentation/README.md)

## Installation and Usage
Please refer to the README.md files within each sub-directory for detailed instructions on how to set up and use each component of the framework.
