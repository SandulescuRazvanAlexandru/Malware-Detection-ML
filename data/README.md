## Dataset Generation and Format

The dataset for this project is generated in real-time using a custom-built System Monitoring Tool. This tool, coded in C#, monitors, logs, and aggregates system and network metrics associated with running processes on a machine. The collected metrics are then formatted into the LIBSVM format, which is commonly used in machine learning projects, especially with Support Vector Machines (SVMs).

### System Monitoring Tool

The System Monitoring Tool is a critical component for data collection. It operates by fetching real-time data every 5 seconds on various process metrics and network connections, aiding in the detection of abnormal behavior or malware activities within a system. The features of this tool include:

- Real-Time Monitoring of System Process Metrics such as CPU Usage, RAM Usage, Total Disk Read/Write, etc.
- Network Connection Data Aggregation, which records protocol, local/foreign addresses, and the state of network connections.
- Data Logging to text files for further analysis.
- A user-friendly interface for monitoring control.

### LIBSVM Format

The collected data is formatted into the LIBSVM format, which structures each data instance on a new line with the following pattern: `<label> <index1>:<value1> <index2>:<value2> ...`. In this project's context, the label `+1` represents "harmless" activities, while `-1` denotes "malware". Each line thereafter specifies the features of the data instance with a particular index denoting the feature position, and the value representing the feature's value. Below is an example of how the data is structured:

+1 1:5.6 2:5.2 3:3.1 4:4.1 5:4.2
-1 1:1.7 2:2.5 3:1.1 4:4.4 5:1.2

### Features

The dataset comprises five main features extracted from the monitored metrics:

1. **Running Hour:** Categorized into six intervals, representing different time frames throughout a day.
2. **Execution Duration:** Grouped into three levels based on the task's execution time.
3. **Volume of Data Exchanged:** Classified into seven intervals based on the amount of data transferred.
4. **Resources Usage:** An index calculated from the usage of CPU, RAM, Network, Disk, and GPU, further categorized into seven intervals.
5. **IP Address:** Analyzed and grouped into four levels based on the nature of the IP address.

Each feature is meticulously crafted to provide a comprehensive view of the system's behavior, aiding in the SVM model's accuracy in distinguishing between normal and malicious activities.

### Dataset Files

The dataset is logged into text files with the filename pattern `dataset.txt`. Each file follows the LIBSVM format, allowing for easy integration with the SVM model for training, testing, and prediction purposes.

### Detailed Description

Detailed description and categorization of each feature are provided in the [documentation](documentation-link). The understanding of these features is crucial for interpreting the SVM model's behavior and the significance of the predictions it provides.
