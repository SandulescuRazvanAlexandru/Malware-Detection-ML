# System Monitoring Tool

The System Monitoring Tool is a C# application designed to monitor, log, and aggregate system and network metrics associated with running processes. It fetches real-time data every 5 seconds on various process metrics and network connections, which can be used for analysis in detecting abnormal behavior or malware activities in a system.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring of System Process Metrics:**
  - CPU Usage (%)
  - RAM Usage (%)
  - Total Disk Read (bytes)
  - Disk Read Rate (bytes/sec)
  - Total Disk Write (bytes)
  - Disk Write Rate (bytes/sec)
  - Total Read Operations Count
  - Read Operations Rate (bytes/operation)
  - Total Write Operations Count
  - Write Operations Rate (bytes/operation)
  - Process Duration (seconds)

- **Network Connection Data Aggregation:**
  - Aggregates network connection data associated with monitored processes.
  - Records protocol, local address, foreign address, and state of network connections.

- **Data Logging:**
  - Logs collected data to text files (`process.txt` and `ActiveConnections[Snapshot {n}].txt`) for further analysis.
  - Merges network connection data with process metrics using Process ID (PID) for comprehensive analysis.

- **User Interface:**
  - A simple and intuitive UI to start/stop monitoring and display collected data.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (Visual Studio recommended).
3. Build and run the project.
4. Use the UI to start monitoring your system.
5. Collected data is logged to `process.txt` and `ActiveConnections[Snapshot {n}].txt` in the project directory.

## Dependencies

- .NET Framework
- Newtonsoft.Json library

**Note:** It is essential to run the application as Administrator to ensure accurate data collection and functionality.
